# The Washington Post's Arc Outbound Feeds skeleton

This is a fusion themes based repository and is intended to be used as the starting point for enabling _out of the box and custom Arc Outboundfeeds_.

## Setup

Pre-requisites:

- node / npm installed (node version > 10).

1. Create a template of this repo. Go to https://github.com/wapopartners/outboundfeeds-skeleton and click on the green "Use this template" button to create a new client repo. Name the new repo starting with the clients name like "ORG-outboundfeeds". Only include the prod branch. Once the new repo is created clone it to your local machine.

```
git clone git@github.com:wapopartners/ORG-outboundfeeds.git
```

2. Create a `.npmrc` in the projects root directory with your github access token. This file is in the .gitignore file and should never be checked into github.

```
@wpmedia:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken={ YOUR AUTH TOKEN HERE }
```

3. Install the packages

```
npm install
```

4. Create .env
